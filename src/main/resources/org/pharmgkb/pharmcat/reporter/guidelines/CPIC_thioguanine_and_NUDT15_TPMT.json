Allow 4-6 weeks to reach steady-state after each dose adjustment. If myelosuppression occurs, emphasis should be on reducing thioguanine over other agents. For non-malignant conditions, consider alternative non-thiopurine immunosuppressant therapy (PMID 20354201). NUDT15 status could not be determined based on genotyping. If thiopurines are required and NUDT15 status is unknown, monitor closely for toxicity.</p>\n<h4 id=\"other-considerations\">Other Considerations</h4>\n<p>Normal starting doses vary by race/ethnicity and treatment regimens.
