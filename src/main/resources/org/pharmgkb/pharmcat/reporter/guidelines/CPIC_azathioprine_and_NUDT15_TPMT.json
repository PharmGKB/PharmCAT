If standard dose is below normal recommended dose, dose reduction might not be recommended for intermediate metabolizers. For patients who are intermediate metabolizers for both TPMT and NUDT15, further dose reduction might be needed compared with those who are only intermediate metabolizers with respect to one gene (TPMT or NUDT15).</p>\n"
