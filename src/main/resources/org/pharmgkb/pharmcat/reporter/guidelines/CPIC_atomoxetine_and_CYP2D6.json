Available information suggests that clinical response is greater in poor metabolizers (PMs) compared to non-PMs and may be related to the higher plasma concentrations 1 to 1.5 hours after dosing in PMs compared to non-PMs administered a similar dose. Furthermore, modest improvement in response, defined as reduction in ADHD-rating scale, is observed at peak concentrations greater than 400 ng/mL. Doses above 120 mg/day have not been evaluated.</p>\n"
