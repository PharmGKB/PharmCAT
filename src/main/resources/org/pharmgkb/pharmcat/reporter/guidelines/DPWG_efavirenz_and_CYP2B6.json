In adults, therapeutic plasma concentrations were achieved at either 2/3rd of the standard dose (1/3rd of the patients) or 1/3rd of the standard dose (2/3rd of the patients). In children younger than 3 years, therapeutic plasma concentrations were achieved at doses of approximately 10 mg/kg per day (as capsules) (100 mg/day for 7-14 kg and 150 mg/day for 14-17 kg; 50-75% of the standard dose).
