However, the results of these studies may apply to other TCAs because these drugs have comparable pharmacokinetic properties.&quot;</li>\n<li>&quot;There is substantial evidence linking <em>CYP2D6</em> and <em>CYP2C19</em> genotypes to phenotypic variability in tricyclic side-effect and pharmacokinetic profiles. Modifying pharmacotherapy for patients who have <em>CYP2D6</em> or <em>CYP2C19</em> genomic variants that affect drug efficacy and safety could potentially improve clinical outcomes and reduce the failure rate of initial treatment.&quot;</li>\n<li>&quot; There are scarce studies focusing solely on <em>CYP2D6</em> or <em>CYP2C19</em> genotype and association with pharmacokinetic parameters or treatment outcomes of TCAs in pediatric patients. CYP2D6 activity is fully mature by early childhood, but CYP2C19 activity may be increased in children relative to adults. Although further genomic ontogeny studies are needed, there is a lack of evidence suggesting that this guideline cannot be extrapolated to pediatric patients.&quot;</li>\n</ul>\n</li>\n<li>The guideline includes dosing recommendation for TCAs based on:\n<ul>\n<li>CYP2D6 phenotype (<a href=\"#table-1-dosing-recommendations-for-tcas-based-on-cyp2d6-phenotype\">Table 1 below</a>)</li>\n<li>CYP2C19 phenotype (<a href=\"#table-2-dosing-recommendations-for-tcas-based-on-cyp2c19-phenotype\">Table 2 below</a>)</li>\n</ul>\n</li>\n<li>Download and read:\n<ul>\n<li><a rel=\"noopener noreferrer\" href=\"https://api.pharmgkb.org/v1/site/redirect?p=https%3A%2F%2Fcpicpgx.org%2Fcontent%2Fguideline%2Fpublication%2FTCA%2F2016%2FTCA_2016.pdf\" target=\"_blank\">Clinical Pharmacogenetics Implementation Consortium guideline for CYP2D6 and CYP2C19 genotypes and dosing of tricyclic antidepressants: 2016 Update</a></li>\n<li><a rel=\"noopener noreferrer\" href=\"https://api.pharmgkb.org/v1/site/redirect?p=https%3A%2F%2Fcpicpgx.org%2Fcontent%2Fguideline%2Fpublication%2FTCA%2F2016%2FTCA_Supplement_2016.pdf\" target=\"_blank\">2016 supplement</a></li>\n<li><a href=\"https://www.pharmgkb.org/page/cyp2d6RefMaterials\">CYP2D6 Gene-specific Information Tables</a></li>\n<li><a href=\"https://www.pharmgkb.org/page/cyp2c19RefMaterials\">CYP2C19 Gene-specific Information Tables</a></li>\n<li><a rel=\"noopener noreferrer\" href=\"https://api.pharmgkb.org/v1/site/redirect?p=https%3A%2F%2Fcpicpgx.org%2Fcontent%2Fguideline%2Fpublication%2FTCA%2F2016%2FImipramine_Drug_Resource_Mappings.xlsx\" target=\"_blank\">Imipramine Drug Resource Mappings</a></li>\n</ul>\n</li>\n</ul>\n<h3 id=\"table-1-dosing-recommendations-for-tcas-based-on-cyp2d6-phenotype\">Table 1: Dosing recommendations for TCAs based on CYP2D6 phenotype:</h3>\n<p><em>Adapted from Tables 1 and 2 of the 2016 guideline update.</em></p>\n<table class=\"table\">\n<thead>\n<tr><th>Likely phenotype</th><th>Activity score</th><th>Genotypes</th><th>Examples of diplotypes</th><th>Implications</th><th>Therapeutic Recommendations<sup>a, b</sup></th><th>Classification of recommendation for other TCAs <sup>c</sup></th></tr>\n</thead>\n<tbody>\n<tr><td>CYP2D6 Ultrarapid metabolizer (~1-20% of patients)<sup>d</sup></td><td>&gt;2.0</td><td>An individual carrying more than two copies of functional alleles</td><td>*1/*1xN, *1/*2xN</td><td>Increased metabolism of TCAs to less active compounds compared to normal metabolizers.

For many rare alleles, no information regarding enzyme activity is currently available, and those with functional data have only been determined by in vitro studies.

Therefore, for the purpose of this guideline the following assignments have been proposed: patients with one decreased function allele and one no function allele are categorized as “likely poor metabolizers” (e.g. CYP2C19*2/*9). For many rare alleles, no information regarding enzyme activity is currently available, and those with functional data have only been determined by in vitro studies. Consequently, the proposed “likely poor” metabolizer assignments were developed for diplotypes that contain one allele with an established effect on enzyme activity and a second allele with limited or no available activity data.</em></p>\n",

Therefore, for the purpose of this guideline the following assignments have been proposed: patients with two decreased function alleles OR patients with one normal or increased function allele AND one decreased function allele are categorized as “likely intermediate metabolizers” (e.g., CYP2C19*1/*9, *9/*9, *9/*17). For many rare alleles, no information regarding enzyme activity is currently available, and those with functional data have only been determined by in vitro studies.

Therefore, for the purpose of this guideline the following assignments have been proposed: patients with one decreased function allele and one no function allele are categorized as “likely poor metabolizers” (e.g. CYP2C19*2/*9). For many rare alleles, no information regarding enzyme activity is currently available, and those with functional data have only been determined by in vitro studies. Consequently, the proposed “likely poor” metabolizer assignments were developed for diplotypes that contain one allele with an established effect on enzyme activity and a second allele with limited or no available activity data.</em></p>\n",

Therefore, for the purpose of this guideline the following assignments have been proposed: patients with one decreased function allele and one no function allele are categorized as “likely poor metabolizers” (e.g. CYP2C19*2/*9). For many rare alleles, no information regarding enzyme activity is currently available, and those with functional data have only been determined by in vitro studies. Consequently, the proposed “likely poor” metabolizer assignments were developed for diplotypes that contain one allele with an established effect on enzyme activity and a second allele with limited or no available activity data.</em></p>\n",

Therefore, for the purpose of this guideline the following assignments have been proposed: patients with two decreased function alleles OR patients with one normal or increased function allele AND one decreased function allele are categorized as “likely intermediate metabolizers” (e.g., CYP2C19*1/*9, *9/*9, *9/*17). For many rare alleles, no information regarding enzyme activity is currently available, and those with functional data have only been determined by in vitro studies. Consequently, the proposed “likely intermediate” metabolizer assignments were developed for diplotypes that contain one allele with an established effect on enzyme activity and a second allele with limited or no available activity data.</em></p>\n",

Therefore, for the purpose of this guideline the following assignments have been proposed: patients with two decreased function alleles OR patients with one normal or increased function allele AND one decreased function allele are categorized as “likely intermediate metabolizers” (e.g., CYP2C19*1/*9, *9/*9, *9/*17). For many rare alleles, no information regarding enzyme activity is currently available, and those with functional data have only been determined by in vitro studies. Consequently, the proposed “likely intermediate” metabolizer assignments were developed for diplotypes that contain one allele with an established effect on enzyme activity and a second allele with limited or no available activity data.</em></p>\n",

For many rare alleles, no information regarding enzyme activity is currently available, and those with functional data have only been determined by in vitro studies.

For many rare alleles, no information regarding enzyme activity is currently available, and those with functional data have only been determined by in vitro studies.

Therefore, for the purpose of this guideline the following assignments have been proposed: patients with one decreased function allele and one no function allele are categorized as “likely poor metabolizers” (e.g. CYP2C19*2/*9). For many rare alleles, no information regarding enzyme activity is currently available, and those with functional data have only been determined by in vitro studies. Consequently, the proposed “likely poor” metabolizer assignments were developed for diplotypes that contain one allele with an established effect on enzyme activity and a second allele with limited or no available activity data.</em></p>\n",
