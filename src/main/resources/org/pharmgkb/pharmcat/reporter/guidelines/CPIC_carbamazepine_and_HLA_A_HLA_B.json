Aromatic anticonvulsants include carbamazepine, oxcarbazepine, eslicarbazepine, lamotrigine, phenytoin, fosphenytoin, and phenobarbital. In addition to HLA-B*15:02, risk for carbamazepine-induced SJS/TEN has been reported in association with the most common B75 serotype alleles in Southeast Asia, HLA-B*15:08, HLA-B*15:11, and HLA-B*15:21. Although not described, the possibility of carbamazepine-induced SJS/TEN in association with less frequently carried B75 serotype alleles, such as HLA-B*15:30 and HLA-B*15:31, should also be considered.</p>\n"
