In case *80 is detected without the *28  or *37 variant present, shown as reference in row 233760233 in the table Calls at Position, not enough clinical data exists to predict metabolizer status with certainty and provide recommendations. However, if data for position 233760233 are listed as missing, *80 can be used to infer metabilzer status."
