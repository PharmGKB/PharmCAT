NOTES:																									
rsID=RefSNP accession ID number (http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/snp/)																									
See Human Cytochrome P450 Allele Nomenclature Committee website (http://www.cypalleles.ki.se) for comprehensive haplotype definitions of CYP3A5 variant alleles and updated allele information.																									
Cytochrome database references nucleotide changes based on NCBI Reference Sequence NG_000004.3 as detailed at http://www.cypalleles.ki.se/cyp3a5.htm.																									
For *9 the existence of the rs776746 (*3) polymorphism on the same allele cannot be excluded.																									
An important caveat for all genotyping tests is that the decision to assign an allele a "wild- type" status is based upon a genotyping test that interrogates only the most common and already-proven sites of functional variation. In human DNA, it is always possible that a new, previously undiscovered (and therefore un-interrogated) site of variation may confer loss-of- function in an individual, and thus lead to the rare possibility of a non-functional allele being erroneously called as "wild-type"																									
Average allele frequencies are based on the actual number of subjects with each allele reported in multiple studies and then grouped according to major race/ethnic groups for studies as defined in https://github.com/PharmGKB/cpic-guidelines/raw/master/tacrolimus/2015/25801146-CYP3A5%20allele%20frequency%20table.xlsx (details and references).
