However, this updated guideline also provides a brief review regarding SLCO1B1 genotype and risk of myopathy for other statins.  Furthermore, comprehensive translation tables mapping SLCO1B1 genotypes to coded genotype/phenotype summaries, EHR priority result notation and interpretation (consultation) text were created to facilitate incorporation of SLCO1B1 pharmacogenetics into an electronic health record with clinical decision support.</p>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p>This guideline is applicable to:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>adult patients</li>\n<li>pediatric patients</li>\n</ul>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p>Excerpt from the 2014 simvastatin dosing guideline:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>&quot;For simvastatin, the evidence linking myopathy to <a href=\"/variant/PA166154579\">rs4149056</a> in SLCO1B1 is of high quality, and this association has been reproduced in randomized trials and clinical practice-based cohorts.

We therefore focus this guideline on simvastatin.&quot;</li>\n</ul>\n</li>\n</ul>\n<p>&quot;In 2011 and updated in 2013, the FDA added warnings to the simvastatin product label to direct providers away from initiating at the 80 mg simvastatin dose. &quot;</p>\n<p>&quot;At lower simvastatin doses (e.g., 40 mg daily), it is our position that SLCO1B1 genotype (if available) could be used to warn providers about modest increases in myopathy risk for patients with a C allele at <a href=\"/variant/PA166154579\">rs4149056</a>. In these circumstances, we recommend a lower dose of simvastatin or use an alternative statin (e.g. pravastatin or rosuvastatin) and we also highlight the potential utility of routine CK surveillance (Table 2). If patients with a C allele at <a href=\"/variant/PA166154579\">rs4149056</a> do not achieve optimal LDL cholesterol-lowering efficacy with a lower dose (e.g. 20 mg) of simvastatin, we recommend the prescribing physician consider an alternate statin based on (i) potency differences (i.e., use a lower dose of a higher potency statin such as atorvastatin, rosuvastatin, or pitavastatin), (ii) drug-drug interactions (e.g., boceprevir, clarithromycin, cyclosporine, strong CYP3A4 inhibitors, etc.), and (iii) relevant co-morbidities (e.g., trauma, significant renal impairment, post-solid organ transplant, thyroid disease etc.).&quot;</p>\n<p>&quot;At the time of this writing, there are no data available regarding SLCO1B1 genotype effects on simvastatin response or myopathy in pediatric patient populations, although there is no reason to suspect that the polymorphisms in SLCO1B1 will affect simvastatin's metabolism differently in children compared to adults.&quot;</p>\n<ul>\n<li>Download and read:\n<ul>\n<li><a rel=\"noopener noreferrer\" href=\"https://api.pharmgkb.org/v1/site/redirect?p=https%3A%2F%2Fgithub.com%2FPharmGKB%2Fcpic-guidelines%2Fraw%2Fmaster%2Fsimvastatin%2F2014%2F24918167.pdf\" target=\"_blank\">The Clinical Pharmacogenetics Implementation Consortium (CPIC) guideline for SLCO1B1 and simvastatin-induced myopathy: 2014 update</a></li>\n<li><a rel=\"noopener noreferrer\" href=\"https://api.pharmgkb.org/v1/site/redirect?p=https%3A%2F%2Fgithub.com%2FPharmGKB%2Fcpic-guidelines%2Fraw%2Fmaster%2Fsimvastatin%2F2014%2F24918167-supplement.pdf\" target=\"_blank\">2014 supplement</a></li>\n<li><a rel=\"noopener noreferrer\" href=\"https://api.pharmgkb.org/v1/site/redirect?p=https%3A%2F%2Fgithub.com%2FPharmGKB%2Fcpic-guidelines%2Fraw%2Fmaster%2Fsimvastatin%2F2014%2F24918167.xlsx\" target=\"_blank\">2014 SLCO1B1 translation table</a></li>\n</ul>\n</li>\n</ul>\n<h3 id=\"table-1-recommended-dosing-of-simvastatin-based-on-slco1b1-phenotype\">Table 1: Recommended dosing of simvastatin based on SLCO1B1 phenotype</h3>\n<p><em>Adapted from Table 1 and 2 of the 2014 guideline update manuscript.</em></p>\n<table class=\"table\">\n<thead>\n<tr><th>Phenotype</th><th>Examples of diplotypes <sup>a</sup></th><th>Genotype at <a href=\"/variant/PA166154579\">rs4149056</a></th><th>Implications for simvastatin</th><th>Dosing recommendations for simvastatin <sup>b,c</sup></th><th>Classification of recommendations <sup>d</sup></th></tr>\n</thead>\n<tbody>\n<tr><td>Normal function, Homozygous wild-type (two normal function alleles)</td><td>*1a/*1a, *1a/*1b, *1b/*1b</td><td>TT</td><td>Normal myopathy risk</td><td>Prescribe desired starting dose and adjust doses of simvastatin based on disease-specific guidelines.</td><td>Strong</td></tr>\n<tr><td>Intermediate function, Heterozygous (one normal function allele plus one decreased function allele)</td><td>*1a/*5, *1a/*15, *1a/*17, *1b/*5, *1b/*15, *1b/*17</td><td>TC</td><td>Intermediate myopathy risk</td><td>Prescribe a lower dose or consider an alternative statin (e.g. pravastatin or rosuvastatin); consider routine CK surveillance.</td><td>Strong</td></tr>\n<tr><td>Low function, Homozygous variant or mutant (two decreased function alleles)</td><td>*5/*5, *5/*15, *5/*17, *15/*15, *15/*17, *17/*17</td><td>CC</td><td>High myopathy risk</td><td>Prescribe a lower dose or consider an alternative statin (e.g. pravastatin or rosuvastatin); consider routine CK surveillance.</td><td>Strong</td></tr>\n</tbody>\n</table>\n<p>CK, creatine kinase.</p>\n<p><sup>a</sup> SLCO1B1 alleles are often named using <a href=\"http://www.pharmgkb.org/gene/PA134865839#tabview=tab4&amp;subtab=33\">star allele nomenclature, representing various SNPs alone or in combination</a> (2014 Update Supplemental Table S1) that are associated with low SLCO1B1 protein expression or function (2014 Update Supplemental Table S2).
