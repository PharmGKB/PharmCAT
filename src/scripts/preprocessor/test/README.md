## Overview

There are two types of files in this directory. One is the test files; and the other is the reference files (expected results).

## Explanation of files

### 1. Test files for bcftools and the preprocessing scripts
1. test.vcf.bgz
2. reference.Sample_1.preprocessed.vcf
3. reference.Sample_2.preprocessed.vcf
4. reference.missing_pgx_var.vcf.bgz


_"test.vcf.bgz"_ are designed for tests on bcftools version as well as the PharmCAT VCF preprocessor. The output from the VCF preprocessor should match the content in *reference.Sample_1.preprocessed.vcf*, *reference.Sample_2.preprocessed.vcf*, and *reference.missing_pgx_var.vcf.bgz*.

### 2. Test files for the VCF proprocessing script - Performance

I tested the performance of the VCF preprocessing script, including run time, multi-sample VCF processing, etc.

The data was the 1000 Genomes Project sequences of Coriell samples with corresponding Genetic Testing Reference Materials Coordination Program (GeT-RM) sample characterization. This dataset was generated by Adam Lavertu, Ryan and Mark for the paper, [_Pharmacogenomics Clinical Annotation Tool (PharmCAT)_](https://doi.org/10.1002/cpt.1568); and is hosted on [the Stanford Digital Repository](https://purl.stanford.edu/rd572fp2219).

```
# Follow the script 01-03 downloaded from the Stanford Digital Repository. You will need to modify the codes, such as file paths.
