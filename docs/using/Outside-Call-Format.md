# Outside Call Format

Typically, PharmCAT uses variant call data to match diplotypes used to find annotations. However, you can also give
diplotypes, phenotypes, or other allele calls to PharmCAT that were called by other tools.

These **outside call files** can be supplied to the [PharmCAT](/using/Running-PharmCAT#outside-calls) tool using the
`-po` flag.

{: .warn}
> Calls specified in this file will override results from the `Named Allele Matcher`.


## File format

The **outside call file** format is a tab-separated file. Lines starting with `#` will be ignored.

Each line has up to 4 fields, separated by tabs:

1. HGNC gene symbol (_required_)
2. Diplotype or single allele call (_required if third and fourth columns not specified_)
3. Phenotype or other gene result (_required if second and fourth columns not specified_)
4. Activity score (_required if second and third columns not specified_)

The second, third, and fourth fields can be used individually or together.

Different genes on different lines can mix whether they give the diplotype, phenotype, or activity values.


### Activity score genes

For [activity score genes](/methods/Matching-Recommendations/#method-2-activity-score-lookup), a provided activity score
value will trump other values.  If you also provide diplotype and/or phenotype value, a warning will be issued if they
do not match the expected values.  For example, if you specify a `*1/*6` diplotype and `4.0` activity score, a warning
will be issued because CPIC expects an activity score of `1.0` for `*1/*6`.

If you don't specify an activity score, PharmCAT will look up the activity score based on the phenotype (if provided)
and then diplotype (if phenotype is not provided).  Once again, PharmCAT will issue a warning if both phenotype and 
diplotype is provided, and they do not match the expected values. 

### Non activity score genes

For non-activity score genes, the activity score is ignored (although it may be displayed in the final report).

If you specify both a diplotype and a phenotype then PharmCAT will _rely on your phenotype_. PharmCAT will issue a
warning if your phenotype does not match the expected phenotype for the given diplotype.


### Example

Here's an example of an outside call file:

```text
CYP2D6	*1/*3
CYP2C9			2.0
HLA-B		*57:01 positive
MT-RNR1	1555A>G
```

Notes:
* the HLA-B line has two tabs between the gene name and the gene result (`*57:01 positive`)
* the MT-RNR1 line specifies a single allele call since that gene is monoploid


## Caveats

We rely on string matching to match outside calls to recommendations.

Consult the [Phenotypes List](/Phenotypes-List) for a complete list of named alleles, phenotypes and activity scores.

_Do not_ prefix allele names with the gene symbol in the second field (e.g. `CYP2C9*1/CYP2C9*3`). The gene is specified in
the first field so repeating it in second field is not necessary.

If there is an outside call for a gene that also has data from the VCF, the outside call will trump the VCF data.


#### Diplotypes

Named allele matching in diplotypes/single allele calls should be fairly straightforward.

If the call is a combination call (e.g. `[*2 + *3]`), it needs to use PharmCAT's combination syntax: it has to be 
wrapped in square brackets (`[` and `]`) and each named allele must be separated with a plus sign with a space on either
side (` + `).  More examples: `*1/[*6 + *8]`, `[*3 + *4 + *5]/[*18 + *37]`.


##### Gene copy number

PharmCAT relies on CPIC or PharmVar gene definitions.  CYP2D6 is the only gene with copy numbers defined in these resources.  Furthermore, PharmCAT only recognizes copy number variations that have a function assignment from CPIC.  Consult the [CYP2D6 phenotypes list](/Phenotypes-List#cyp2d6) for the full list. These alleles are part of the CPIC diplotype to phenotype translation and can be connected to a corresponding recommendation.  Some copy number variations (e.g. for `*1`, `*2` and `*4`) over 3 are combined in a single bin (≥3).  So if you have `*1x3` or `*1x5`, you will need to translate that to `*1≥3`.

PharmCAT will automatically attempt to translate your CYP2D6 copy number variation into a matching CPIC copy number variation if possible.

**IMPORTANT**: PharmCAT expects files encoded in UTF-8.  This is particularly important when it comes to the "≥" signs that are used in copy number names.

#### Phenotypes

When providing phenotypes, you will need to use
[CPIC standardized terms](https://cpicpgx.org/resources/term-standardization/), although we do provide some
interpretation:

1. We automatically normalize spelling (e.g. "metabolizer" instead of "metaboliser") and capitalization.
2. We will translate common synonyms:
    * PM = Poor Metabolizer
    * IM = Intermediate Metabolizer
    * NM = Normal Metabolizer
    * EM = Normal Metabolizer
    * UM = Ultrarapid Metabolizer

   Note that CPIC uses "normal" instead of "extensive", so the translation from "EM" above to "Normal Metabolizer" is not a mistake. 
3. We will try to extract the main phenotypes above if possible.  For example, "CYP2D6 Ultrarapid Metabolizers (UM)" becomes "Ultrarapid Metabolizer".
4. Some CPIC standardized terms for phenotypes include modifiers such as "likely" or "possible".  We retain these modifiers.  For example, "likely cyp2c19 poor metaboliser" becomes "Likely Poor Metabolizer".

#### Activity Scores

String matching also applies to activity scores.  PharmCAT only recognizes CPIC assigned
activity scores.  For example, one possible CPIC activity score for CYP2D6 is "≥6.0".  If you provide "7.0", this will result in a no call.  Similarly, if CPIC defines activity scores of "0.0" and "0.25", and you provide "0.1", this will also result in a no call.
