  "textHtml" : "<p>The <strong>American College of Rheumatology</strong> guidelines for the management of gout include the following statement about pharmacogenomic testing for HLA-B*58:01 and allopurinol:</p><blockquote><p>Those with HLA-B*5801 and of Korean descent with stage 3 or worse CKD (HLA-B*5801 allele frequency ~12%), or of Han Chinese or Thai extraction irrespective of renal function (HLA-B*5801 allele frequency ~6-8%), have been highlighted in the literature as prime examples of subjects at high risk for AHS, marked by HLA-B*5801 hazard ratios of several hundred.  Such high-risk individuals were recommended to be prescribed an alternative to allopurinol if HLA-B*5801 positive.</p></blockquote><p>excerpted from <a href=\"/download.do?objCls=Attachment&amp;objId=GuidelinesHLABallopurinolACR.pdf\">2012 American College of Rheumatology Guidelines for the Management of Gout.
