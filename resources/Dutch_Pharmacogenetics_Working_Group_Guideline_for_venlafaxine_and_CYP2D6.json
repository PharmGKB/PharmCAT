  "textHtml" : "<p>The Royal Dutch Pharmacists Association - Pharmacogenetics Working Group has evaluated therapeutic dose recommendations for venlafaxine based on CYP2D6 genotypes [Article:<a href=\"/pmid/21412232\">21412232</a>].  For PM and IM genotypes, they state that there are not sufficient data to allow calculation of dose adjustment, and they recommend selecting an alternative drug or adjusting dose to clinical response and monitoring (O-desmethyl)venlafaxine plasma concentration.  For UM genotypes, they recommend titrating dose to a maximum of 150% of the normal dose(based on venlafaxine and (O-desmethyl)venlafaxine plasma concentration) or selecting an alternative drug.</p><table class=\"table table-striped table-condensed table-hover table-bordered\"><tr><th> Phenotype (Genotype) </th><th> Therapeutic Dose Recommendation </th><th> Level of Evidence </th><th> Clinical Relevance </th></tr><tr><td> PM (two inactive (*3-*8, *11-*16, *19-*21, *38, *40, *42) alleles) </td><td> Insufficient data to allow calculation of dose adjustment.
